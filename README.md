## About Game 
In my game, the player is in control of a long snake-like creature that moves around on a bordered plane, gathering food
, while attempting to avoid hitting its own tail or the playing area's edges. 

The snake's tail lengthens as it consumes food, making the game harder with each new piece. The user can move the 
snake's head up, down, left, or right, and the body will move in the same way.

### Note:
* To move UP press "w" on your keyboard.
* To move DOWN press "s" on your keyboard.
* To move LEFT press "a" on your keyboard.
* To move RIGHT press "d" on your keyboard.


#### P.S:
* Once you collide with tail or playing area, my game stops and displays your score.
* My high score is 33...
